        <p>Number - 1 2 3 45 678</p>
        <p>Boolean - have only two value - "TRUE" or "FALSE"</p>
        <p>Undefined - this type has only one value. It means the variable has been created but has never been given a value.  It is nothing because no one has ever bothered to tell it what value it should be. </p>
        <p>Null - is similar to undefined, except it has to be set intentionally. It also means empty or nothing, but itâ€™s that way because a developer told it, it was empty or nothing. </p>
        <p>Bigint - it's a type of data for numbers more than 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n. this type of data is creating by adding n to the numbers  </p>
